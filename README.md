Hands-on tutorial on Nextflow and Containers (Docker and Singularity). Paris 2018.
For this tutorial we need to install Nextflow (https://www.nextflow.io/), Singularity (http://singularity.lbl.gov/) and Docker (https://www.docker.com/).

- For installing NextFlow we need Java version 1.8. You can check with "java -version". Then just type "curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash" for installing a local copy in your current directory. Finally type "./nextflow run hello" for testing. 

We go in the first folder **test1**
***cd test1; ls***
nextflow.config  params.config  test.nf
